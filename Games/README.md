# JavaWork
This was one of the major assignments for my Java programming module. We had to implement a CLI game system with a functional leaderboard; leaderboard persistence was optional, but I was able to store the leaderboard file as a seperate text file, visible as "leaderboard.txt"

As an element of OOP, classes of users for playing the game were specified; regular, VIP, and restricted users can access the game with different benefits/status effects. This is also reflected in the leaderboard.
