# JavaWork
This was one of the major assignments for my Java programming module. We had to implement a CLI-based game system.

with a functional leaderboard; leaderboard persistence was optional, but I was able to store the leaderboard file as a seperate text file, visible as "leaderboard.txt"

As an element of OOP, classes of users for playing the game were specified; regular, VIP, and restricted users can access the game with different benefits/status effects. This is also reflected in the leaderboard.

Some features include:

1. Three fun games! Pick from a simple dice game; rocker-paper scissors; or the famous Monty Hall game! Now with a Unicode goat.
2. A fully functional and persistent leaderboard that is saved between play sessions! Try beat your high score.
3. Three different player class types; regular, VIP, and restricted.
4. An input validation method (Validation.java) that is invoked by passing a range of acceptable values for a user to input; any incorrect or impossible values throw an InputMissmatchException and terminate the program.
